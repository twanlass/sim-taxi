# Rendering

Three.js r0.180. **Zero external assets** — every mesh is generated in code, there is no loader,
no texture and no model file.

## The low-poly look

Three things produce it:

1. **Non-indexed geometry + `flatShading: true`.** Shared vertices would smooth normals across
   faces; keeping geometry non-indexed is what gives every facet its own hard edge.
2. **Baked vertex colours.** `bakeColor()` in `util/geo.js` writes a colour into a geometry's
   vertex attribute before merging. Hundreds of props with dozens of colours then collapse into
   **one mesh with one material**, because colour rides in the geometry rather than the material.
3. **Position-keyed jitter.** `jitterVertices()` displaces vertices keyed on their **position**,
   not their index.

> That last point was a real bug. `IcosahedronGeometry` is non-indexed, so a shared corner appears
> as several separate vertices. Jittering per-index pushed each copy a different way and tore the
> tree canopies open. Keying on position keeps the surface welded.

`palette.js` holds every colour in the game by name, plus `jitterColor()` for per-instance
variation. New colours belong there, not inline.

## Camera

`src/game/camera.js`. A fixed 3/4 orthographic camera:

```js
VIEW_DIR = (1, 0.92, 1)   // looking down the +X+Z diagonal
DISTANCE = 400
zoom     = 52             // vertical world span is exactly 2 * zoom
```

No pan, no zoom. That's a gameplay decision, not a limitation — a fixed frame is what makes every
tap unambiguous and lets the whole city stay on screen.

The `VIEW_DIR` diagonal has consequences elsewhere: screen-up is world `(-1, 0, -1)`, which is why
the timer ring starts its sweep at `-3π/4`, and why riders are placed on the `-X-Z` kerb of a
junction — the block on the `+X+Z` side sits between the camera and anything standing on it.

Because the camera is orthographic, world-units-per-pixel falls straight out of the frustum
height: `(2 * zoom) / clientHeight`. The route line uses this to hold a constant pixel width.

> This also explains why an early "invisible" skid mark wasn't invisible at all — it was 0.3 units
> wide, and at play zoom 1 unit ≈ 7.7px, so it rendered as 2px. Effects that need to *read* at play
> zoom must be sized against the camera, not by eye in a close-up.

## Lighting

`src/game/scene.js` returns `{ scene, sun, hemi, sky }`:

- **`sun`** — a directional light with shadows (`PCFSoftShadowMap`)
- **`hemi`** — a hemisphere light for ambient fill
- **`sky`** — the *material* of a sky dome, whose `topColor` / `bottomColor` uniforms are the only
  handle on sky colour

The default is golden hour: 16:24, sun 28.5° up, `#FFDEBB` at 3.55 intensity.

## Day/night cycle

`src/game/daylight.js` owns the hour → lighting curve. **Currently switched off by default** —
`main.js` calls `setCycling(false)`, so the game sits at the fixed golden hour above. The ⚙️ panel
turns it on.

`createDaylight({ sun, hemi, sky })` gives you `apply(hour)`, `update(dt)`, `setCycling`,
`setDayLength`. One full day takes `DAY_SECONDS = 180` by default.

**Eight keyframes** (midnight, pre-dawn, sunrise, morning, noon, golden, sunset, dusk) are lerped
for sun colour, intensity, ambient fill, hemisphere sky/ground and both sky uniforms. Keyframes
rather than a formula because a smooth analytic curve spends most of its range on a flat blue
afternoon and rushes the two minutes that actually look like something.

Sun elevation follows a day arc and azimuth swings 10° → 175°, so shadows sweep across the city.
**Elevation clamps at 6°** — at night intensity is 0 anyway, and a light below the ground plane
throws shadows up through everything.

Night is genuinely dark (sun 0.00, fill 0.34, deep navy) but stays playable because every game
marker — fare rings, beacon, route line — is `MeshBasicMaterial` and therefore unlit.

Screenshot mode freezes the cycle: a rendered shot has to be reproducible.

## Effects

### Skid marks — `game/skidmarks.js`

A ring buffer of flat quads stamped onto the road while boosting **through a corner**. Alpha lives
in a 4-component vertex colour attribute. Pure black, `MARK_LENGTH = 1.5`, `MARK_WIDTH = 0.58`,
`START_ALPHA = 0.85`, spaced closer than one mark length so stamps overlap into a streak.

> `car.state === 'turn'` covers **every** junction crossing including going straight on, which is
> why rubber first appeared on the straights. A real turn is `car.dOut !== car.d`, and only after
> the straight run-up (`leadIn`) is done.

### Dust — `game/dust.js`

An `InstancedMesh` of **squashed low-poly spheres** (`IcosahedronGeometry(0.5, 0)` — 20 faces, so
the facets show), scaled `(w, 0.55, 1)` so a puff spreads over the road rather than balling up, with
per-puff aspect and a slow tumble. Lit with `MeshLambertMaterial` + `flatShading`, so it picks up
the same sun as the cars.

Emitted whenever the taxi is boosting *and moving* — not only in corners like the rubber, since the
point is to make speed itself read.

> Per-puff alpha needs a custom `aAlpha` instanced attribute plus a three-line `onBeforeCompile`
> patch multiplying it into `gl_FragColor.a`. `instanceColor` cannot carry it: it is RGB only, and
> a 4-component colour attribute triggers `USE_COLOR_ALPHA` and a different code path.

An earlier version used camera-facing billboards. They sat in the same plane as the road and read
as flat stickers next to the faceted cars.

### Route line — `game/routeline.js`

A ribbon on the road showing the planned route. Held at a constant ~2px using the
world-units-per-pixel factor above. Shown only while the taxi has a pending target — the route is a
property of the *selection*, not of the world.

Once planned it does **not** re-path as the taxi drives; a line that keeps changing under you is
unreadable.

### Car motion

Cars get a subtle vertical bounce while driving and **roll into corners** for weight. The roll is
applied with a compensating lift:

```js
lift = Math.abs(Math.sin(roll)) * (CAR_W / 2)
```

Without it, leaning pushes the outer wheels underground. The taxi's ground disc is *not* rolled
with the body — it used to be, and tilting it into the road caused z-fighting.

## Debug panel

`src/game/debugpanel.js`, behind the ⚙️ button top right. Split by cost:

- **Live** — day cycle on/off, day length, time of day, sun colour/strength, ambient fill, fare clock
- **Restart to apply** — car count (writes a URL parameter and reloads)

Pretending a rebuild-only value is live would just show a slider that silently does nothing.

Touching any lighting control stops the day cycle, rather than letting the next frame overwrite the
change. **Copy settings JSON** exports the live values (not the slider positions, so manual
overrides are captured) for pasting back as new defaults.
