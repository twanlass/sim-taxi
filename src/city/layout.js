  // the city rather than skirting an edge — together they form a cross. Four arterials (the
  // previous count) meant most junctions had an arterial on at least one axis, which flattened
  // the hierarchy back out.
  //
  // They run signal-free, like the ring: side streets yield into a gap, and the one junction
  // where the two arterials cross each other keeps a light. (An arterial used to mean a 64%
  // green share and a coordinated wave direction instead; dropping the lights entirely is what
  // makes them read as *real* main roads rather than an invisible timing tweak.) Registering
